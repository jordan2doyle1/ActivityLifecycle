# ActivityLifecycle

Activity Lifecycle is a simple tutorial application used in the Udacity Android training course. The original app can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/android-lifecycle). The purpose of the application is to demonstrate how the activity lifecycle methods in the Android framework operate for both Activity and Fragment classes. This version of the application has been extended to include location queries, to demonstrate the retrieval of location updates within the Android framework.
