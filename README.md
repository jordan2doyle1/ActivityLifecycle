# Activity Lifecycle

Activity Lifecycle is a simple tutorial application used in the Udacity Android training course. The original application can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/android-lifecycle). Its purpose is to demonstrate how the activity lifecycle methods from the Android framework operate for both Activity and Fragment classes. This version of the application has been extended to include location queries, demonstrating the retrieval of location updates within Android.
